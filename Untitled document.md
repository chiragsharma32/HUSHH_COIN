# **YOU ARE BUILDING THE FULL INTERACTIVE UI/UX OF A PRODUCT CALLED “HUSHH”.**

You are not writing backend logic.  
 You are not implementing blockchain.

Your ONLY responsibility:

### **Design and generate a fully interactive, clickable website prototype (Next.js \+ Tailwind \+ ShadCN \+ Framer Motion) that perfectly matches the visual style, flow, and structure of the Hushh AI platform.**

The prototype must behave like a real app:

* All buttons clickable

* Vault opens with animation

* Offers open

* Permissions popups appear

* Withdraw screens work

* Navigation works

* Every page fully designed with content

  ---

  # **🟣 PROJECT INFORMATION — INCLUDE THIS LOGIC IN UI**

This platform is a **Privacy-Preserving User Data Vault** where:

### **🌟 Users store their data in an encrypted vault.**

Data includes:

* spending

* loyalty memberships

* fitness/wearables

* social influence

* preferences

* demographic buckets

**Raw data never leaves the vault.**

---

### **🌟 Signals are generated inside the vault**

Examples:

* "Beauty spend: high"

* "Fitness spend: medium"

* "Age bucket: 22–27"

* "Has loyalty memberships"

* "Frequent online shopper"

These signals are **anonymous** and used for matching.

---

### **🌟 Brands NEVER see raw data.**

They only receive:

* anonymous user ID

* yes/no signal match result

* ability to send offer

* acceptance results

* aggregated analytics

Brands CANNOT see:

* identity

* purchases

* bank statements

* GPS

* contacts

* emails

* phone numbers

  ---

  ### **🌟 Matching is done privately using Zero-Knowledge Proofs**

ZK proves:

* “User spends \>X in category”

* “User is in age bucket”

* etc.

Without revealing raw info.

---

### **🌟 Users earn money when they approve a brand offer**

Users DO NOT earn when vault collects data.

Users earn ONLY when:  
 1️⃣ A brand wants users with certain signals  
 2️⃣ The user matches  
 3️⃣ The user approves access  
 4️⃣ Brand pays in HUSHH coin  
 5️⃣ User receives the reward

---

### **🌟 HUSHH coin is a stablecoin**

Value \= **$1 always**

Backed by real USD reserves.

Used because:

* Smart contracts need a programmable unit

* Internal economy must be consistent

* All rewards/payments are automated

* Arbitrage keeps price at $1

* Brands must buy HUSHH to run campaigns

* Users redeem anytime to INR/USDT/USD

  ---

  ### **🌟 Why brands cannot use INR/USDT**

* No smart contract automation

* No internal accounting

* No ZK compatibility

* No reward distribution

* No closed-loop economy

* No platform revenue logic

* No spend tracking

HUSHH coin \= programmable dollar of the ecosystem.

---

### **🌟 User redemption flow**

1. User clicks withdraw

2. chooses Bank / UPI / USDT

3. HUSHH burns

4. $1 per coin released from reserve

5. converts to INR/USDT

6. user receives money

   ---

   # **🟣 YOU MUST BUILD UI FLOW FOR EVERYTHING ABOVE**

   ---

   # **🎨 VISUAL STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (COPY HUSHH AI EXACTLY)**

You MUST copy the design style of Hushh AI:

* Futuristic ⚡

* Neon purple–blue gradients

* Dark theme with glassmorphism

* Soft glowing borders

* Floating cards

* Smooth Apple-like animations

* Big rounded components

* Minimal, premium, futuristic feel

* Subtle neon hover effects

* Ambient glow backgrounds

* SF Pro / Inter font

EVERY screen must reflect this aesthetic **exactly**.
